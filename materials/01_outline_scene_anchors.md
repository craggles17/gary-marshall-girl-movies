## Draft outline (scene-anchored)

### 0) Cold open: the binge spiral
- Hook: what happens when you watch Marshall too fast (conspiracy-brain, line-by-line “is this a nod?”).
- Thesis preview: self-reference isn’t trivia; it’s a system for steering expectation and reward.

### 1) What you mean by “girl movie” (and why Marshall exploits it)
- Define your usage (not dismissive; “girl movie” as marketing genre + affective contract).
- “About girls” as an *aesthetic* promise (faces, makeover arcs, romance inevitability) rather than the literal subject.

### 1.5) The jab (make it explicit): you’re not mocking women, you’re mocking the machine
- Say it plainly: you like these actresses; the critique is aimed at Hollywood’s star factory.
- Flatness as a clue: these films often privilege **persona circulation** over interior character growth.
- Framing hypothesis (flagged as conjecture): “*Love Actually* in LA” as a studio-friendly container Marshall uses for a love letter to LA *and* a complaint about the industry.
- Historical echo (one paragraph, then move on): Rita Hayworth as an emblem of “repainted by the system” (use sparingly; don’t let it become a second essay).

### 2) The original spell: *Pretty Woman* as a generator of future expectations
- The movie as a template the audience carries forward (class-crossing fantasy, makeover, deal-to-feelings arc).
- Star persona gets forged here: Roberts as the emotional tuning fork.

**Scene anchors**
- Vivian’s transformation sequence / shopping montage as “reward loop” (the genre paying you on schedule).
- The deal (time-bound contract) as a narrative timer you’ll see again in holiday films.

### 3) The sequel-that-isn’t: *Runaway Bride* as engineered déjà vu
- Roberts + Gere reunion under Marshall = the simplest, loudest self-reference.
- The film isn’t repeating *Pretty Woman* accidentally; it’s testing how little it must change to make novelty.

**Scene anchors**
- Any early setup that positions Gere’s character as an “expert” on Roberts’ character (audience proxy).
- The “multiple grooms” structure as micro-seriality (the same story told again and again inside one film).

### 4) Royalty as a different kind of makeover: *Princess Diaries* 1–2
- Girlhood as institution: etiquette, presentation, lineage—social training as narrative engine.
- The makeover is no longer private (romance) but public (monarchy), widening the “girl movie” scope.

**Scene anchors**
- The makeover + etiquette training (mechanical reward beats; visible “leveling up”).
- Coronation/public reveal moments as the spectacle version of “happily ever after.”
- Early “before” baseline where Mia reads as a blank-slate/new-face (the movie can install a role onto her).
- Repeated correction beats (posture/voice/dining rules) where comedy masks the coercion of compliance training.
- Paparazzi / public-image pressure as the real plot engine (stabilizing the “princess” artifact, not Mia’s interiority).
- Julie Andrews as a loaded signifier: Mary Poppins’ “benevolent discipline” repurposed as royal finishing school (interpretive, but high-yield).

### 5) The ensemble holiday film as the Marshall multiverse (*Valentine’s Day*, *New Year’s Eve*)
- Ensemble is an attention-management device: frequent resets, constant mini-cliffhangers, rapid rewards.
- Star casting becomes the point: the audience is watching faces as much as stories.

**Scene anchors: Valentine’s Day**
- The airplane seatmate scene: Roberts beside Cooper, framed like rom-com destiny.
- The airport convergence: how multiple storylines “pay off” in quick succession.

**Scene anchors: New Year’s Eve**
- Hospital thread (timed survival / countdown logic).
- Any “we’re all connected” montage mechanics (the holiday as an editing excuse).

### 6) The trick: expectation/reward engineering (your main analytical lens)
- Treat genre familiarity as a predictive model in the viewer’s head.
- Marshall feeds that model: repetition, casting echoes, beat timing, “inevitability” cues.
- Then he cashes it in: surprise isn’t random; it’s built on overconfidence.

**Write it like this**
- Name 6–10 “high signal” nods (casting reunions, structural repeats, shot grammar).
- Refuse the weak stuff (“not every line is a nod—here’s how to tell”).

### 7) Close: what the binge reveals that single-viewing hides
- The thesis, restated as a feeling: nostalgia turns to suspense; romance becomes camouflage.
- Final line option: “In Marshall, the callback is not a wink—it’s a steering wheel.”

## Quick list: “high-signal nods” to hunt and pin down
- Roberts/Gere reunion under Marshall (*Pretty Woman* → *Runaway Bride*).
- Time-bound contracts and countdowns (deal, wedding deadline, holiday clock).
- Makeover as an explicit reward beat (visible leveling, public recognition).
- Ensemble editing rhythm as a dopamine schedule (setup/payoff compressed).
- Roberts + Cooper seatmate beat as a deliberately “classic” setup (then recontextualized).
- Orson Welles shoutout in *Valentine’s Day* (only include if you can locate the exact line/scene and quote it accurately).
