### Template A: Cold pitch (outline + angle)

Subject: Pitch: Garry Marshall’s self-referential “girl movies” as expectation machines

Hi [Name],

I’m pitching a reported/close-reading essay (~[1,500–2,500] words) on how Garry Marshall’s “girl movies” (*Pretty Woman*, *Runaway Bride*, *The Princess Diaries*, and the ensemble holiday films) use self-reference—especially casting and repeated reward beats—to engineer audience expectation. The piece argues that familiar rom-com grammar becomes misdirection, which is why *Valentine’s Day* can pivot late into payoffs centered on queer love and parent-child reunion and still feel surprising.

What makes this timely/fit for [Outlet]: [1 sentence: their audience + why this angle suits them].

If helpful, I can send a full draft within [X] days; for now I’ve included a short outline below.

Outline (very short)\n- Hook: binge-watching Marshall and “everything feels like a nod”\n- The template: *Pretty Woman* and the reward loop\n- Engineered déjà vu: *Runaway Bride*\n- Institutional makeover: *Princess Diaries*\n- Ensemble editing as dopamine schedule\n- The *Valentine’s Day* misdirection payoff\n

### Template B: “Finished draft” submission (fast)

Subject: Essay submission: The Julia Roberts multiverse in Garry Marshall

Hi [Name],

I’m sending a finished essay (~[word count]) that argues Garry Marshall’s romantic comedies use self-reference—casting echoes, makeover beats, and deadline structures—to train viewer expectations and then profit from that training. The center of gravity is *Valentine’s Day*, where a classic-seeming seatmate setup becomes misdirection for a different set of love stories.

If this is a fit, I’m happy to revise to your preferred length and house style.

### Template C: Substack/Medium “editor’s note” (for self-pub)

Title: Watching too much Garry Marshall makes you see the gears

Note to readers:\nThis essay is a close read of Garry Marshall’s “girl movies”—from *Pretty Woman* to *Valentine’s Day*—as machines for expectation and reward. Binge them and the self-reference stops being cute; it becomes the point.
