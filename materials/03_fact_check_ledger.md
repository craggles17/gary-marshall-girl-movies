### Your key claims (plot-level)

- **In *Valentine’s Day*, Julia Roberts and Bradley Cooper share a plane/flight scene as seatmates.**
  - Status: Confirmed (basic beat)
  - Notes: Keep it simple in the draft: “Roberts’ character (Kate) sits next to Cooper’s character (Holden) on a flight.”
  - Sources: `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentine%27s_Day_(2010_film)`; IMDb plot summary (for a second confirmation).

- **The film later recontextualizes that “rom-com seatmate” beat with an ending reveal that centers queer love (Bradley Cooper’s storyline).**
  - Status: Confirmed (core fact); Interpretation (your framing)
  - Notes:
    - Fact: Holden is in a relationship with a man (Sean).
    - Interpretation: the earlier seatmate scene is framed like a rom-com setup and is later “flipped.”
  - Sources: `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentine%27s_Day_(2010_film)`; IMDb plot summary.

- **The end of *Valentine’s Day* includes a parent-child reunion involving Julia Roberts’ character.**
  - Status: Confirmed (core fact)
  - Notes: Kate reunites with her son (Edison).
  - Sources: `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentine%27s_Day_(2010_film)`; IMDb plot summary.

### Valentine’s Day (2010) specifics you can safely name in the draft (verified via Wikipedia plot/cast)

- **Roberts plays Captain Kate Paddington-Hazeltine; Cooper plays Holden Wilson; Eric Dane plays Sean Jackson; Bryce Robinson plays Edison Hazeltine.**
  - Status: Confirmed
  - Sources: `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentine%27s_Day_(2010_film)`

- **Plot beat summary (for accurate phrasing)**: Kate is on a one-day leave and meets Holden on a flight to Los Angeles; Holden later reunites with Sean; Kate arrives home late to greet her son, Edison.
  - Status: Confirmed (high-level)
  - Sources: `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentine%27s_Day_(2010_film)`

### Your key claims (interpretation-level: keep labeled as interpretation)

- **“Modern day Richard Gere” = Bradley Cooper in *Valentine’s Day*.**
  - Status: Interpretation (not a fact claim)
  - Notes: Keep it as “reads like” or “is framed as,” and then show *how* the scene invites that expectation (shot grammar, dialogue tone, Roberts’ presence).

- **“Infinity gauntlet of leading ladies” / “phenotypic Julia Roberts” across Marshall’s films.**
  - Status: Interpretation / metaphor
  - Notes: Make the metaphor operational by naming 4–6 concrete traits you’re tracking (cadence, moral framing, makeover vector, public recognition payoff, etc.).

- **“Most details and lines are nods.”**
  - Status: Overclaim (unless you restrict it)
  - Notes: Convert into: “The films are built to *make you search for nods*.” Then provide a controlled set of high-signal examples and explicitly reject weak ones.

### New hooks you want to weave in (with fact/interpretation split)

- **Rita Hayworth was born Margarita Carmen Cansino (and became a Golden Age star under the name Rita Hayworth).**
  - Status: Confirmed
  - Notes: Use as a *brief* historical bridge for “the machine repainting women into images.”
  - Sources: `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rita_Hayworth`

- **Rita Hayworth had a personal tie to Orson Welles (they were married; she had a daughter with him).**
  - Status: Confirmed (basic biographical fact)
  - Notes: Only relevant if you want a tight “Welles/Hayworth” echo; don’t force it.
  - Sources: `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rita_Hayworth`

- **Julie Andrews starred in *Mary Poppins* (1964) and later in *The Princess Diaries* (2001) / *The Princess Diaries 2* (2004).**
  - Status: Confirmed
  - Notes: This is the factual backbone for your “Mary Poppins is an interesting choice” intertext.
  - Sources: `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Andrews`

- **“Mary Poppins persona” → Queen Clarisse as benevolent discipline / finishing-school engine.**
  - Status: Interpretation
  - Notes: Keep it grounded in the training scenes so it reads as analysis, not vibes.

- **Orson Welles gets a shoutout in *Valentine’s Day* (exact line).**
  - Status: Unverified
  - Notes: Do not include as fact until you can locate the line/scene (rewatch with subtitles, or find a reliable transcript).
  - Sources to verify: film text (best); a reputable transcript (if available).

### New Year’s Eve (quick sanity checks to pin down)

- **Julia Roberts appears in *New Year’s Eve* (2011).**
  - Status: False
  - Notes: She is **not** in the cast. (The “Nurse Aimee” character is played by Halle Berry, not Roberts.)
  - Sources: `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Year%27s_Eve_(2011_film)`

## “Fail fast” note (how to phrase uncertain items in the draft)
- If you can’t confirm a detail from a source or by rewatching, **don’t write it as fact**.
- Use: “The scene *plays like* X” (interpretation) vs “The film *shows* X” (fact).
