## One-paragraph thesis (variants)

### Thesis A (clean, high-level)
Garry Marshall’s “girl movies” don’t just star women; they **stage womanhood as branding**, using a familiar constellation of faces (and the public meanings attached to them) to make the audience feel they already know what kind of love story they’re watching. The trick is that the films’ most “obvious” promise—romance, repetition, the Julia Roberts vibe—functions less as the point than as **a delivery system for surprise**: casting echoes become a control panel for your expectations, so that when *Valentine’s Day* pivots into parental love and closeted love in its final movements, it lands like an ambush. In Marshall, self-reference isn’t winking garnish; it’s the engine that turns nostalgia into suspense.
*The Princess Diaries* makes the same mechanism unusually visible: identity becomes a manufactured output (etiquette, image, public recognition), and the audience is asked to mock the machine while still wanting it to “work.”

### Thesis B (more voice, binge-watching frame)
Watch one Garry Marshall romantic comedy and you get a story; watch too many in a week and you start to feel like you’re trapped inside a machine that manufactures recognition. The machine runs on faces—especially Julia Roberts, then a flood of adjacent star personae—reproduced across roles and eras, an “infinity gauntlet” of leading-lady energy that convinces you the movie is “about girls” even when the real payload is how **your reward system** works: setup, callback, payoff, repeat. The ensemble holiday movies (*Valentine’s Day*, *New Year’s Eve*) push that logic to parody, using star persona as a decoy so the most conventional seatmate-on-a-plane scene can flip into a reveal about queerness, motherhood, and what counts as a happy ending.

### Thesis C (tight + pitchable)
Across *Pretty Woman*, *Runaway Bride*, *The Princess Diaries*, and the ensemble holiday films, Garry Marshall uses **self-reference as narrative engineering**: casting, trope repetition, and “girl movie” iconography build a sense of inevitability that the films then exploit for emotional reversals. In *Valentine’s Day*, the movie’s loudest promise—romantic destiny—becomes misdirection, so that the ending’s tender emphasis on queer love and parent-child reunion feels unexpectedly weighty. Marshall’s trick is simple and strange: he makes familiarity behave like suspense.

### Thesis D (more theoretical)
Marshall’s work treats celebrity as a text you’ve already read. By foregrounding star personas and recycled romantic setups, the films create a self-referential loop in which the viewer’s prior knowledge becomes part of the script. The “girl movie” frame is not simply representational; it’s **a heuristic** that steers interpretation, shaping what we anticipate and what we notice. The late-film reveals in *Valentine’s Day* demonstrate the payoff: when romance is overdetermined by genre memory, other kinds of love can arrive as a shock.

### Thesis E (a bit meaner / sharper)
The secret of Garry Marshall’s “girl movies” is that they’re not naïve; they’re predatory in the nicest possible way. They sell you repetition—Julia Roberts, romantic archetypes, holiday timelines—then use that repetition to modulate your attention, turning the predictable into camouflage. Binge them and you’ll start seeing nods everywhere, because the films are built to make you search for them. In Marshall, the callback is a leash: it keeps you close until the story swerves.

### Thesis F (your new frame: Gary vs. Hollywood)
Garry Marshall sold Hollywood simple romantic comedies, then filled them with moments that refuse to let his leads be dolls. Even *Pretty Woman*—pitched as a fairy tale, digestible enough for any boardroom—is laced with beats that assert Vivian's wit, her terms, her refusal to settle for partial dignity. The "girl movie" container was a Trojan horse: Marshall fed studios what they wanted while embedding a love letter to LA and a quiet protest against the star-making machinery that flattens actresses into consumable symbols. The films look "flat" on purpose—because Marshall's target isn't character depth; it's the system that pretends persona *is* depth. We're not laughing at the women onscreen; we're siding with Marshall against the machine that keeps feeding them into templates.

## Premise rewrite (fact-friendly version of your current take)
Marshall repeatedly assembles stories that *feel* like they’re “about girls” because they emphasize leading-lady iconography and romantic-comedy inevitability. But that emphasis is also a form of misdirection: in *Valentine’s Day*, Julia Roberts’ character (Kate) sits beside Bradley Cooper’s character (Holden) on a flight in a beat that plays like classic rom-com destiny, only to be reframed by the ending’s emphasis on queer love and a parent-child reunion. The self-reference isn’t only between films; it’s between the viewer’s memory of the genre and the movie’s willingness to cash it in for surprise.

## Constraints / scope notes (for drafting sanity)
- I’m using “phenotypic Julia Roberts” as a **metaphor**: a cluster of signals (smile, cadence, star aura, “America’s sweetheart” coding), not literal lookalikes.
- I’m treating “modern-day Richard Gere (Bradley Cooper)” as **your interpretive claim**, not a factual one; the factual claim is simply that the film seats Roberts and Cooper together and plays that beat against audience expectation.
- I’m aiming the jab at **Hollywood’s star-making machinery**, not at the actresses (who are the evidence of what the machinery does, for better and worse).
- “*Love Actually* in LA” is a **framing hypothesis**, not a fact claim about what Marshall literally pitched.
- The Mary-Poppins resonance is **Julie Andrews as a persona** (benevolent authority + transformation-through-discipline) showing up again in *Princess Diaries* as a kind of “finishing school” engine.
