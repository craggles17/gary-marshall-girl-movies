### Your key claims (plot-level)

- **In *Valentine’s Day*, Julia Roberts and Bradley Cooper share a plane/flight scene as seatmates.**
  - Status: Confirmed (basic beat)
  - Notes: Keep it simple in the draft: “Roberts’ character (Kate) sits next to Cooper’s character (Holden) on a flight.”
  - Sources: `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentine%27s_Day_(2010_film)`; IMDb plot summary (for a second confirmation).

- **The film later recontextualizes that “rom-com seatmate” beat with an ending reveal that centers queer love (Bradley Cooper’s storyline).**
  - Status: Confirmed (core fact); Interpretation (your framing)
  - Notes:
    - Fact: Holden is in a relationship with a man (Sean).
    - Interpretation: the earlier seatmate scene is framed like a rom-com setup and is later “flipped.”
  - Sources: `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentine%27s_Day_(2010_film)`; IMDb plot summary.

- **The end of *Valentine’s Day* includes a parent-child reunion involving Julia Roberts’ character.**
  - Status: Confirmed (core fact)
  - Notes: Kate reunites with her son (Edison).
  - Sources: `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentine%27s_Day_(2010_film)`; IMDb plot summary.

- **In *Runaway Bride*, Maggie Carpenter leaves multiple fiancés at the altar before the film’s main timeline.**
  - Status: Confirmed (plot premise)
  - Notes: Film depicts/recaps at least three prior weddings plus Ike’s article about them.
  - Sources: `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runaway_Bride_(film)`; film rewatch for exact number of grooms.

- **Ike Graham is a USA Today columnist assigned to profile Maggie, positioning him as the story’s commentator.**
  - Status: Confirmed
  - Notes: Cite opening act setup (bar scene + editor assignment) for accuracy.
  - Sources: `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runaway_Bride_(film)`

### Valentine’s Day (2010) specifics you can safely name in the draft (verified via Wikipedia plot/cast)

- **Roberts plays Captain Kate Paddington-Hazeltine; Cooper plays Holden Wilson; Eric Dane plays Sean Jackson; Bryce Robinson plays Edison Hazeltine.**
  - Status: Confirmed
  - Sources: `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentine%27s_Day_(2010_film)`

- **Plot beat summary (for accurate phrasing)**: Kate is on a one-day leave and meets Holden on a flight to Los Angeles; Holden later reunites with Sean; Kate arrives home late to greet her son, Edison.
  - Status: Confirmed (high-level)
  - Sources: `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentine%27s_Day_(2010_film)`

### Your key claims (interpretation-level: keep labeled as interpretation)

- **“Modern day Richard Gere” = Bradley Cooper in *Valentine’s Day*.**
  - Status: Interpretation (not a fact claim)
  - Notes: Keep it as “reads like” or “is framed as,” and then show *how* the scene invites that expectation (shot grammar, dialogue tone, Roberts’ presence).

- **A *Grey’s Anatomy* reference can function as an intertextual address that over-solicits comfort until it flips uncanny.**
  - Status: Interpretation (mechanism claim)
  - Notes:
    - Keep “female viewers” phrasing careful: “for many women viewers” / “for viewers with intimate serialized familiarity.”
    - Treat the *Princess Diaries* connection as **high-risk**: *Grey’s Anatomy* premiered in 2005, while *The Princess Diaries* (2001) and *The Princess Diaries 2* (2004) predate it—so this is likely a memory slip unless you can point to a later re-release/addition.
    - For *Valentine’s Day* (2010): do not state the reference as fact until you can locate the moment (what’s said/shown, and in which scene).
  - Sources to verify: film text (rewatch + timestamp) for *Valentine’s Day*; if you meant a different show in *Princess Diaries*, name it and we’ll swap it in.

- **“Infinity gauntlet of leading ladies” / “phenotypic Julia Roberts” across Marshall’s films.**
  - Status: Interpretation / metaphor
  - Notes: Make the metaphor operational by naming 4–6 concrete traits you’re tracking (cadence, moral framing, makeover vector, public recognition payoff, etc.).

- **“Most details and lines are nods.”**
  - Status: Overclaim (unless you restrict it)
  - Notes: Convert into: “The films are built to *make you search for nods*.” Then provide a controlled set of high-signal examples and explicitly reject weak ones.

- **Mia (Anne Hathaway) “grows into” a socially tradable role the way Vivian “grows into” respectability in *Pretty Woman*.**
  - Status: Interpretation
  - Notes:
    - Keep this framed as “reads like” / “PG transactional cousin,” not literal prostitution.
    - Anchor it in film text: deal/training/makeover mechanics + public-recognition payoff.
    - Avoid stating “debt” as a plot fact unless you can cite it cleanly.

### New hooks you want to weave in (with fact/interpretation split)

- **Rita Hayworth was born Margarita Carmen Cansino (and became a Golden Age star under the name Rita Hayworth).**
  - Status: Confirmed
  - Notes: Use as a *brief* historical bridge for “the machine repainting women into images.”
  - Sources: `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rita_Hayworth`

- **In *Valentine’s Day*, Jennifer Garner wears a slip/nightie reminiscent of her look in *13 Going on 30*.**
  - Status: Unverified
  - Notes: Keep phrasing interpretive (“reads like an echo”) unless/until you confirm on-screen.
  - Sources to verify: film text (rewatch; ideally grab a timestamp/screencap).

- **Rita Hayworth had a personal tie to Orson Welles (they were married; she had a daughter with him).**
  - Status: Confirmed (basic biographical fact)
  - Notes: Only relevant if you want a tight “Welles/Hayworth” echo; don’t force it.
  - Sources: `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rita_Hayworth`

- **Julie Andrews starred in *Mary Poppins* (1964) and later in *The Princess Diaries* (2001) / *The Princess Diaries 2* (2004).**
  - Status: Confirmed
  - Notes: This is the factual backbone for your “Mary Poppins is an interesting choice” intertext.
  - Sources: `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Andrews`

- **“Mary Poppins persona” → Queen Clarisse as benevolent discipline / finishing-school engine.**
  - Status: Interpretation
  - Notes: Keep it grounded in the training scenes so it reads as analysis, not vibes.

- **Orson Welles gets a shoutout in *Valentine’s Day* (exact line).**
  - Status: Unverified
  - Notes: Do not include as fact until you can locate the line/scene (rewatch with subtitles, or find a reliable transcript).
  - Sources to verify: film text (best); a reputable transcript (if available).

### New Year's Eve (quick sanity checks to pin down)

- **Julia Roberts appears in *New Year's Eve* (2011).**
  - Status: False
  - Notes: She is **not** in the cast. (The "Nurse Aimee" character is played by Halle Berry, not Roberts.)
  - Sources: `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Year%27s_Eve_(2011_film)`

- **Editorial decision: *New Year's Eve* scope**
  - Decision: Keep as passing mention, not primary example.
  - Rationale: Roberts isn't in it; *Valentine's Day* carries the thesis. Mention NYE to show the ensemble holiday pattern, but don't anchor specific scenes.

## “Fail fast” note (how to phrase uncertain items in the draft)
- If you can’t confirm a detail from a source or by rewatching, **don’t write it as fact**.
- Use: “The scene *plays like* X” (interpretation) vs “The film *shows* X” (fact).
