## Claims → evidence table (draft)

> Use this as your “argument debugger”: every paragraph should cash out into at least one row here.

| Claim | Film(s) | Evidence to cite (scene/detail) | How it supports the argument | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Marshall uses star persona (esp. Roberts) as a viewer-control system, not just casting. | All (esp. Roberts films) | Marketing posture + repeated “Roberts-type” narrative beats across films. | Moves “self-reference” from trivia to mechanism (expectation steering). | Medium |
| A mass-familiar comfort-TV reference (e.g., *Grey’s Anatomy*) can over-solicit recognition until it flips uncanny. | Holiday ensemble films (candidate); anywhere it appears | Identify the specific reference (what’s shown/said) + where it occurs; describe how quickly the scene “feels known” *because* of the TV cue. | Adds a sharper affective step in your mechanism: comfort → estrangement, not just nostalgia → wink. | Low–Medium (until you pin exact examples) |
| *Pretty Woman* establishes a beat-timed reward loop that later films reuse. | Pretty Woman | Transformation/shopping montage; contract-to-feelings arc; “deadline” structure. | Defines the template the audience later expects. | Medium |
| *Runaway Bride* is engineered déjà vu: same leads + similar romantic grammar under same director. | Runaway Bride; Pretty Woman | Roberts/Gere reunion; rom-com framing that encourages comparison. | Demonstrates explicit inter-film self-reference. | High |
| The *Princess Diaries* films translate the makeover reward loop into institutional girlhood (etiquette, lineage, public reveal). | Princess Diaries 1–2 | Training sequences; public identity reveal; “leveling up” structure. | Shows “girl movie” as social performance; expands your framework beyond romance. | Medium |
| Ensemble holiday films compress reward schedules: constant setup/payoff cycles across storylines. | Valentine’s Day; New Year’s Eve | Cross-cutting mini-arcs; convergence montage; holiday countdown. | Explains why binge-watching triggers “everything is a nod.” | Medium |
| *Valentine’s Day* uses a “classic rom-com” setup (Roberts seated beside Cooper) as misdirection. | Valentine’s Day | Plane seatmate scene; later recontextualization at airport. | Shows expectation weaponized: “this will be romance” → “this is something else.” | High (for plot); Medium (for intention) |
| The end of *Valentine’s Day* foregrounds parent-child reunion and queer love as emotional payoffs that land harder because romance was overpromised. | Valentine’s Day | Kate’s reunion with her son; Holden’s relationship reveal/airport moment. | Backs your “surprise ending” claim with specific beats. | High (for plot); Medium (for framing) |
| Binge-watching creates a “conspiracy mode” because the films are built from high-salience repetition cues. | All | Repeated structures: deadlines, makeovers, public declarations, montage payoffs, star casting. | Turns your personal viewing experience into an analytic result. | Medium |
| Not every detail is a nod; the trick is that Marshall makes you *want* to read it that way. | All | Pick 6–10 “high-signal” callbacks; explicitly discard weak ones. | Keeps the piece credible; prevents overclaiming. | Medium |
| The ensemble holiday films feel “*Love Actually* in LA,” but the point isn’t depth; it’s a city-love-letter container that lets Marshall critique Hollywood from inside a studio-friendly format. | Valentine’s Day; New Year’s Eve | Ensemble structure; holiday framing; LA-as-stage (locations, professions, industry adjacency). | Reframes “flatness” as an intentional symptom of persona-circulation over character interiority. | Low–Medium (as intention); Medium (as reading) |
| Hollywood repaints women into consumable images; the modern star economy is a softer version of the old studio system. | All (bridge) | Brief historical aside: Rita Hayworth as emblem of the studio makeover logic. | Aims the essay’s jab at infrastructure, not at actresses; gives historical depth. | Medium |
| Julie Andrews’ Mary Poppins persona is repurposed in *Princess Diaries* as “benevolent discipline,” turning makeover into compliance training dressed as warmth. | Princess Diaries 1–2 | Julie Andrews casting as Queen Clarisse; training/etiquette scenes. | Links your “Mary Poppins is interesting” instinct to a precise interpretive mechanism. | Medium (as reading) |
| The essay’s target is Hollywood, not the performers: the actresses are the “evidence” of a system that needs women to be legible symbols. | All | Say it explicitly early; then point to how quickly films lean on persona shortcuts. | Keeps tone humane; prevents the read from sounding like you’re blaming women for the machine. | High |

## Candidate “high-signal” evidence set (keep it small on purpose)
- Roberts/Gere reunion under Marshall (*Pretty Woman* → *Runaway Bride*)
- Makeover/training sequences as visible reward beats (*Pretty Woman*, *Princess Diaries*)
- Deadline/countdown logic (contracts, weddings, holidays)
- Ensemble cross-cutting as dopamine schedule (*Valentine’s Day*, *New Year’s Eve*)
- Roberts/Cooper seatmate beat → recontextualized ending (*Valentine’s Day*)

- Why does he like **ensemble structures** (many storylines) and how does he manage payoffs?
- Does he describe the holiday films as **vignettes**, **cross-cutting**, or “mini-movies”?
- Does he talk about **stars as a hook** (audience buys in fast, so you can move quicker)?

6) **Valentine’s Day plane seatmate misdirection**
- Does Marshall discuss **holding back information** / “reframes” / “twists” in the holiday films?
- Does he describe the goal as **surprise**, **inclusion**, **multiple kinds of love** (not just romance)?

- Does he describe his movies as **accessible** / “for everybody,” not inside-baseball?
- Any quote that supports your moderation move: pick a few high-signal echoes, ignore the rest.
